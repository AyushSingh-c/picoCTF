this code is used to encode the flag string 
    ''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])

For each pair of characters in flag, convert them to their Unicode code points using the ord() function. 
    For example, ord('a') returns 97.
For the first character of the pair, perform a bitwise left shift operation by 8 bits using the << operator. 
    This means moving the bits of the number 8 places to the left, adding zeros at the right end. 
    For example, ord('a') << 8 returns 24832, which is 97 in binary shifted 8 bits to the left: 01100001 becomes 0110000100000000.
Add the code point of the second character of the pair to the result of the previous step using the + operator. 
    For example, (ord('a') << 8) + ord('b') returns 24930, which is 24832 plus 98 (the code point of ‘b’).
Convert the result back to a character using the chr() function. 
    For example, chr(24930) returns '瀀', which is a Chinese character.
Join all the resulting characters into a single string using the ''.join() method.

this is a common method to convert utf-8 strings to utf-16 strings
