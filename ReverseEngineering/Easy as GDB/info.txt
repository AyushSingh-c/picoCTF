This is weird 
    we are taking an input string in the executable and taking xors and permutate this string and compare it to a password string stored in &DAT_00012008
    we need to sent a perfect string(which is the flag) to get the correct verdict

    we can do this by adding chars one by one in the flag and checking on the correct condition if it is met or not 
        if the condition is met then the added char is correct
        ot it is not
    Now the problem is we are permuting the flag so the ith value in flag may not be responsible for ith value of password

To run the python code with gdb module
    gdb ./{executable} -x ./{python_file}

flag - picoCTF{I_5D3_A11DA7_61b3a698}
