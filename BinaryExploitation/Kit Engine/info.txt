The server code is given to us in python script
we can see that the server executes the ./d8 file with the input provided by the user

If we go to the source of the d8 executable(provided as a zip file) we see a patch folder
this patch contains a function AssembleEngine() that takes a array of doubles and execute them 
 
./d8 is a developer shell of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine withh a vulnerable patch

this is a sample test below
