the addr of flag string is - 0x603800
the addr of rand string is - 0x603890
the addr(pointed by) the flag string pointer is - 0x6034a0
the addr pointed by the local_80 var(local_80+0x10) is printing with puts - 0x6038a0(it is 0x10 + 0x603890(now the local_80))
now we want to change the value at 0x602089 from 0x60(38)90 to 0x60(34)90
we can do is 0x6034a0 + offset = value
    value = 0x34 = '4'(value is taken as %c)
    offset = 0x602089 - 0x6034a0 = -5143(offset is taken as %d)

This will not work all the time because heap memory is kind of aslr so all the addresses are randomized but the last three hexadecimal digits (as with Glibc or PIE binaries) We are modifying the fourth and third digits of an address

we can make this work by sending multiple queries or print the first addr values i.e 0x603800 values
this way we only ahve to change the last 2 digits in hex values(from 0x6038(90) to 0x6038(00))
now the new value = \0
new offset = -5144
    dont know why it is same
