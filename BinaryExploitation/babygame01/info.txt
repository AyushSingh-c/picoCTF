we need to solve the game
to solve the game we need to reach the 29,89 square
we start from the 4,4 square
after we reach the 29,89 square program checks a value in an addr
    if its non zero program prints the flag

variables to look for:
    the player position array
        x/24wx 0xffffc454
        0xffffc454 - row of player
        0xffffc458 - column of player
        0xffffc45c - special varibale which should be non zero

    the map that is being edited by the move_player function
        x/24wx 0xffffc460
        start of the array is 0xffffc460

move_player
    this function changes the value in this addr to player tile
        (*param_1 * 0x5a + param_3 + param_1[1]) = player_tile;
            *param_1 - row number
            param_1[1] - column number
            param_3 - 0xffffc460

    this function also solve the puzzle with p option
    this function change the player tile with l option
    this function also changes the player location with wasd options

solution
    we can make the row number 0 and column number -4 to edit the special variable to player_tile
    print w 4 times and a 8 times then print p
