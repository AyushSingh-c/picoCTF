win() start addr - 0x0804975d
move_player() return stack pointer - 0xffffc39c -> 0x08049709
pointer for the start of the map - 0xffffc3c3
    to get this value u can calculate it from 
        *(undefined *)(*param_1 * 0x5a + param_3 + param_1[1]) = player_tile;
    or you can look into the spaces near the ebp register
        EBP: 0xffffc398 --> 0xffffce58 --> 0x0 
            means the EBP values is 0xffffc398
            value at EBP is 0xffffc398
        we can examine area near EBP    
            x/24wx 0xffffc388
            we see
                0xffffc388:	0x0804bf0c	0xf7ffcb77	0x0804c000	0x0804bf0c
                0xffffc398:	0xffffce58	0x08049709	0xffffc3b8	0x00000077
                0xffffc3a8:	0xffffc3c3	0x080496eb	0x00000004	0x00000001



now we can travel to main() return address 
    90*x+y+0xffffc3c3 = 0xffffc39c
    ==> x=0x0 y=-0x27

the value of player_tile is changed to one of the nop instruction
    anything b/w 0804976f to 08049778
