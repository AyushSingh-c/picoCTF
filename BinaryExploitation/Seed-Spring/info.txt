time(0) is used as a seed to the srand function
    this value is the time now stored in seconds in system

to exploit this we need to predict the values came fomr the rand function in the server
    so somehow we need to generate those same numbers 
    we have to make sure the time should be same to the second for us and the server process

I dont know why the server is running the code one every connection
    i tried to make the same kind of server on local to see how is it possible
    we can do this simply by 
        ./getpayload | ./seed_spring
    or if we want to make a netcat server   
        from one command window 
            nc -l -p 1234 -e /home/ayush/Work/picoCTF/BinaryExploitation/Seed-Spring/seed_spring
        from another command window
            ./getpayload | nc localhost 1234

solution
    ./getpayload | nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 35856
