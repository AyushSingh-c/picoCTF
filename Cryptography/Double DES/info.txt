Simple 2-DES vuln
    the complexity is not (key-length)^2 but key-length
    we will generate a plaintext(P) and encryption(E) pair
    we will iterate through all possible keys
        make all possible encryption T1 = DES_ENC(P,Ki)
        make all possible decryption T2 = DES_DEC(E,Ki)
    we will compare all T1 and T2 and take Ki where Ts are equal
    Now we will use these keys to decrypt flag
    Final complexity - key-length (10^6)
