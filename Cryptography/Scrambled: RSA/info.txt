SOLUTION    
    Create a string known of known characters.
    Ask to encrypt 'p', verify that E1('p') is in E1(flag), and append 'p' to known.
    Loop over all printable characters, and for each printable character c, ask to encrypt known + c.
    Extract (some value related to) E1(c) from the ciphertext and check if that value is in E1(flag).
    If it is, break out out of the loop and append c to known. If c happens to be '}', print known and exit; Otherwise go to step 2.
    If it isn't, continue to the next character.
