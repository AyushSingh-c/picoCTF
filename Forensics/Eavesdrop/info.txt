we get a packet snapshot 
    we can get this conversation from the TCP connection between 10.0.0.4 and 10.0.0.15
        Hey, how do you decrypt this file again?
        You're serious?
        Yeah, I'm serious
        *sigh* openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt -k supersecretpassword123
        Ok, great, thanks.
        Let's use Discord next time, it's more secure.
        C'mon, no one knows we use this program like this!
        Whatever.
        Hey.
        Yeah?
        Could you transfer the file to me again?
        Oh great. Ok, over 9002?
        Yeah, listening.
        Sent it
        Got it.
        You're unbelievable
    between the packets "Yeah, listening." and "Sent it" we would have the file.desc3 file
