We analyse the pcap file
    the calls to /flag endpoint is frequent
    A lot of the DNS queries have a destination of 8.8.8.8. However, a subset have a destination for 18.217.1.57.
    with filter 
        dns and ip.dst==18.217.1.57
    we can find that the calls are made to multiple subdomains of reddshrimpandherring.com
    we can append these subdomains in sequence of time

        when we base64 decode it we get the flag

flag - picoCTF{dns_3xf1l_ftw_deadbeef}
