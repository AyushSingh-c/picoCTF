        pavucontrol # A GUI will pop-up, go to the "Output Devices" tab to verify that you have the "virtual-cable" device
        qsstv # The program GUI will pop-up, go to "Options" -> "Configuration" -> "Sound" and select the "PulseAudio" Audio Interface
        # Back in the pavucontrol GUI, select the "Recording" tab and specify that QSSTV should capture audio from the Null Output
