given a binary and an encoded image we need to find the flag hidden in the image
    in the binary 
        we are reading the flag byte by byte  
        for every bit in the byte we are taking an AND with 1 and storing it in the last bit of the encoded image from an ofset 2000
        we are also substracting 5 for some reason 

Flag - picoCTF{n3xt_0n30000000000000000000000000899f0192}
