        Immediately what jumped out at me are the two characters ‘PK’ in the decoded text. ‘PK’ encoded into hex is \x50\x4b, which are the first 2 bytes of each signature used to denote different structures within a PKZip archive. The first signature of a PKZip archive should be \x50\x4b\x03\x04 (local file header signature) so the next 2 bytes after \x50\x4b in our hex dump should be \x03\x04.
    we can pick up the bytes (2 pick 2 loose) and make a new file
        this will be a zip file we can extract to find  a text file with flag
