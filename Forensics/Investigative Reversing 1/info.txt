Given a binary and  3 encoded image
    Encoding
        Append byte 1 to file 3
        Add 0x15 to byte 0 and append to file 2
        Append byte 2 to file 3
        Append byte 5 to file 3. At the top of the file the variables are listed like so:
        char local_38 [4]; // 4 is length
        char local_34;
        char local_33;
        This means that local_34 will contain the 4th character from flag and local_33 will contain the 5th. So in the below lines the 5th bytes is added then the 4th.
        fputc((int)local_33,__stream_02);
        fputc((int)local_34,__stream_00);
        Append byte 4 to file 1
        Append bytes 6 to 9 (inclusive) to file 1
        Append byte 3 (which has been increased by 4 during the above loop) to file 2
        Append bytes 10 to 14 (inclusive) to file 3
        Append bytes 15 to 25 (inclusive) to file 1
    we need some tail bytes from the files
        mystery.png - 16 bytes
            xxd -g 1 mystery.png | tail
                43467b416e315f36393030386237357d 
        mystery2.png - 2 bytes
            xxd -g 1 mystery2.png | tail
                8573
        mystery3.png - 8 bytes
            xxd -g 1 mystery3.png | tail
